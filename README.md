# Genetic Algorithm for DotA 2 Team Composition
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate optimal team compositions for DotA 2 heroes. The GA evaluates different combinations of heroes based on specific metrics, such as hero stats, roles, and win rates, to help players build effective teams.
